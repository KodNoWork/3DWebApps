          This 3D web app was created for the 3D Web Apps module at the
          University of Sussex. The project focuses on showcasing 3D models of
          Coca-Cola products — a Coke can, sprite can, and Sprite bottle — all
          built in Blender and loaded into the browser using Three.js.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          The models were made in Blender, with attention to clean geometry and
          proper materials. I used UV mapping to apply brand textures, and
          exported the files as <code>.glb</code> to keep things lightweight and
          compatible.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the website, I used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Three.js was the main library for rendering the models. I followed the
          basic MVC philosophy: the HTML acts as the View, JavaScript the logic
          (Controller), and the models represent the Model part. I also added
          some interactivity like wireframe toggles, lighting controls, and
          buttons to switch between models different coloured lighting to make
          it easier to discern the lightings effect on the models.

        <h2>Design Choices</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to keep the layout simple so the 3D models were the main
          focus. I used a dark background to help the can textures stand out
          better, and made sure the page was responsive so it works on both
          laptops and phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font and colors were kept clean and minimal, with some tweaks to
          match the Coca-Cola aesthetic without overdoing it.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          I tried to consider accessibility where possible — I used semantic
          HTML, labeled buttons clearly, kept the contrast strong for
          readability. There's still room for improvement, but it works decently
          across different devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I ran the app locally with a Python HTTP server and tested it in
          Chrome and Firefox. I checked that models loaded properly, buttons
          worked, and that the site adjusted well to screen size changes using
          my phone and macbook. I manually tested all the interactive features
          like model switching, wireframe toggle, and lighting changes.
